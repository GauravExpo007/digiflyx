            <p>
                A major step towards raising the relevancy of product reviews in search results was taken by Google in
                February 2024 with their Product Review Update. This is among the top recent Google updates 2024, and

            <p>
                Google’s February 2024 Product Review Update brought some important changes to how product reviews are
                ranked. It started giving more importance to reviews written by experts or those with deep knowledge of
                the product. Reviews that go into detail about a product’s performance, features, and value were
                rewarded, while overly promotional or biased reviews were penalized. Google also emphasized the need for
                honest, unbiased reviews by encouraging a mix of positive as well as negative opinions to help users
                make better-informed decisions.

            <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl xl:text-4xl">The March 2024 Core Update</h2>
            <p>

                2024 core update began on March 5. Updates to numerous core systems caused larger swings in results than
                normal. According to Google, this upgrade would cut away 40% of irrelevant information from search
                results; it took up to a month for it to take effect. Google significantly refined the way search
                results are produced by integrating its helpful content technology into its overall core ranking
                mechanism.

                Scaled content abuse is defined by Google as the practice of mass-producing material by humans or
                automated systems to increase rankings. Furthermore, it was considered spam to rank low-quality material
                utilizing expired domains. By using both manual operations and its spam detection technologies, Google
                countered these attempts, and by March 20, it had finished the deployment in just 14 days.

            <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl xl:text-4xl">The June 2024 Spam Update</h2>
            <p>
                Google is always battling spam & poor-quality content. This is one of the recent Google updates 2024 to
                avoid spammy content that makes websites less noticeable. You should make sure your website does not use
                black-hat SEO techniques and complies with Google’s requirements for high-quality content.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was one of the few important Google updates that assign negative ratings to websites with sparse or
                poor-quality content or overuse of keywords. Google’s June 2024 Spam Update introduces improvements to
                SpamBrain, the AI-based system for detecting search spam. It will ensure it catches new and evolving
                types of spam. Sites affected by the update should review and comply with Google’s spam policies to
                avoid penalties, such as lower rankings or removal from results. Changes made to comply with these
                policies will help improve site performance over time, but in the case of link spam, any ranking benefit
                previously gained from spammy links is permanently lost when the update neutralizes those effects.
